                This project was for the Wild Animal Mini-Zoo. We were to build a page for the interns using HTML semantic tags and lists that showed each type of animal at the zoo, the names of each animal, some info about those animals and an external fact page.

               This project was to create a grocery list to make shopping easier. We were to build a page using sections and CSS that showed different categories of groceries and then different sections in those categories with lists of items needed.

                This project was to create a piece of artwork for a gallery. We were to build a page that showcased our artwork using advanced CSS techniques such as z-index and display. We also included a form that could be submitted if someone wanted to make a purchase.
